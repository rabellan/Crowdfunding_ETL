# Crowdfunding_ETL
UC Berkeley Extension Data Analysis Project 2 ETL Challenge

This ETL mini project is a practice in building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

After transforming the data, four CSV files will be created. From the said CSV files data, an ERD and a table schema were created to illustrate the table relationship. To finish the ETL project, the data from the derived CSV files will be imported into a Postgres database.
